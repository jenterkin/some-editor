Just expiramenting with making a text editor. Planning on making a modal editor that supports python to extend it.

## What is has
- syntax highlighting! (for rust)
- h/j/k/l movement
- scrolling (ctrl+e/y)
- out-of-bounds crashes

## What it doesn't have (but soon will)
- tests
- docs
- any actual editing capabilities
- plugin support (via embedded python)
